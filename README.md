## Description
It utilizes some undocumented YouTube APIs to get the raw video url and plays the stream using the decoder taken from [Video player for 3DS by Core-2-Extreme](https://github.com/Core-2-Extreme/Video_player_for_3DS).  
It does not run any javascripts or render html/css, so it's significantly faster than YouTube on the browser.  
The name is derived from the fact that it is the third YouTube client on 3DS, following the official YouTube app (discontinued) and the new 3DS browser.

## Features

 - Livestreams and premiere videos support  
 - Searching  
 - Video suggestion  
 - Comments  
 - Captions  
 - Local watch history and channel subscription  
 - No ads  
   It's more like "Ads are not implemented" rather than "We have ad-blocking functionality".  
   Of course, we will never "implement" it :)

## Requirements
A 3DS (including 2DS) with [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS) installed and [DSP1](https://github.com/zoogie/DSP1) run.  
I haven't tested the minimum system version, but at least 8.1.0-0 is needed.  

## FAQs

 - Does it make sense?  
   The **worst** question in the console homebrew scene. Isn't it just exciting to see your favorite videos playing on a 3DS?

  Needless to say, the video playback functionality is essential for this app, and it would not have been possible to develop this software without him spending his time optimizing the code sometimes even with assembly and looking into HW decoding on the new 3DS.

  As a reference about YouTube webpage parsing. Thanks to its strict dependency-free policy, I was able to port some of the code without difficulty.
